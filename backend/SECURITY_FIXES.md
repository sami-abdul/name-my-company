# Critical Security Fixes Applied

## Overview

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified during the code audit and the fixes that have been implemented.

## Fixed Critical Issues

### 1. Authentication Security Vulnerability ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: The system relied on easily spoofed `x-user-email` headers for authentication.

**Risk**: Complete authentication bypass possible, allowing unauthorized access to user data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented proper Supabase Auth integration with JWT token validation
- Added `authenticateUser` middleware using Bearer token authentication
- Updated auth routes to use secure authentication
- Modified controllers to work with authenticated user objects
- Added automatic user creation in database when authenticated via Supabase

**Files Modified**:
- `src/config/supabase.ts` - Added Supabase Auth client
- `src/middleware/validation.ts` - Added `authenticateUser` middleware
- `src/controllers/authController.ts` - Updated to use authenticated user
- `src/routes/authRoutes.ts` - Added authentication requirement
- `src/routes/domainRoutes.ts` - Secured protected endpoints

### 2. AI Service Import Bug ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: CommonJS `require()` used in ES6 module context, causing potential runtime errors.

**Risk**: Application crashes in strict TypeScript environments, service unavailability.

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced `require('groq-sdk')` with proper ES6 dynamic import
- Added asynchronous initialization function for Groq client
- Implemented proper fallback to OpenAI when Groq is unavailable
- Added API key validation before attempting to use services

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/aiService.ts` - Fixed import and initialization logic

### 3. SQL Injection and Input Validation ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Insufficient input validation allowed potential SQL injection and XSS attacks.

**Risk**: Database compromise, data theft, malicious script execution.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced input sanitization middleware with SQL injection pattern detection
- Added comprehensive validation for all database operations
- Implemented email validation with regex patterns
- Added string length limits and character filtering
- Secured all user inputs before database operations
- Added production-safe error logging (no sensitive data exposure)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/middleware/validation.ts` - Enhanced sanitization and validation
- `src/config/supabase.ts` - Added input validation for all database functions

## Security Measures Now In Place

### Authentication
- ✅ JWT-based authentication via Supabase
- ✅ Bearer token validation for all protected endpoints
- ✅ Automatic user session management
- ✅ Secure user profile creation and retrieval

### Input Validation
- ✅ Email format validation with regex
- ✅ String length limits (email: 255 chars, prompt: 500 chars, etc.)
- ✅ SQL injection pattern detection and prevention
- ✅ XSS script tag removal
- ✅ HTML tag sanitization
- ✅ Recursive object sanitization

### Database Security
- ✅ Parameterized queries via Supabase (prevents SQL injection)
- ✅ Input validation before all database operations
- ✅ Production-safe error logging
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables

### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Request sanitization middleware
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling without data leakage

## Testing

A comprehensive security test suite has been added to verify these fixes:

- ✅ SQL injection attempt prevention
- ✅ Invalid email rejection
- ✅ XSS script tag filtering
- ✅ Input length validation
- ✅ Authentication token validation

Run tests with: `npm run test:integration`

## Migration Notes

### For Existing API Clients

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Authentication is now required for protected endpoints.

**Before**:
```javascript
fetch('/auth/user', {
  headers: {
    'x-user-email': 'user@example.com'
  }
})
```

**After**:
```javascript
fetch('/auth/user', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + supabaseAuthToken
  }
})
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure you have the required Supabase environment variables:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

## Remaining Security Considerations

While the critical issues have been fixed, consider these additional security measures for production:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement Redis-based distributed rate limiting
2. **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly
3. **Monitoring**: Add security event logging and monitoring
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications use HTTPS in production
5. **Headers**: Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ Security validation tests pass
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (with deprecation warnings)

The system is now secure for production deployment with proper authentication and input validation.
